# rlrankcheckerbot
This is a Discord bot that uses Selenium and ChromeDriver to access the ranks of players in an online game called Rocket League

It also has Database capabilities to make the repetitive search of players easier for the user 
  The Database holds the player's name, steamID/epicID (specific to each individual player of the game), and the platform they use
  This allows the user to only need to know the players name to use the command !search/{name} rather than having to repeatedly use the !steam/!epic commands with the corresponding steamID/epicID

Made this as a side project because I thought it would be fun for our community Discord server
